# Python Implementation of the Honeycomb Maze
This is the python implementation of O'Keefe's Honeycomb Maze.
- It uses the Khephera IV Robots 
- on a Hexagonal grid using the ./lineFollowJunction11 command running on them

# Requirements
The program requires the following repositories

- _networkx_: for network analysis for pathfinding
- _matplotlib_: for network visualisation
- _paramiko_: for SSH connection to the robots
- _logging_: for logging the status of the maze

# Getting Started

See files from [integration_testing](honeycomb_maze/integration_testing) for example implementations of the program working.
